# E-commerce Revenue Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze the revenue generated by an e-commerce company in January 2021, categorized by customers. The revenue calculation is based on specific criteria related to transaction types and statuses.

## Revenue Calculation Rules
- **Type of Transaction:**
  - `BUY`: When a customer purchases something, the transaction amount is considered potential revenue.
  - `SELL`: When a customer sells something, the platform collects a fee equal to 10% of the transaction amount, which is also considered potential revenue.

- **Transaction Status:**
  - `COMPLETED`: Transactions with this status are included in the revenue calculation.
  - `PENDING`: Transactions with this status are ignored.
  - `CANCELED`: Transactions with this status are void, and 1% of the transaction amount is deducted from the revenue.

## Output Requirements
The analysis should provide the following columns in the output:
- `customer`: Customer's identifier.
- `buy`: Revenue generated from 'BUY' transactions.
- `sell`: Revenue generated from 'SELL' transactions.
- `total`: Total revenue, which is the sum of 'buy' and 'sell'.

Revenue values should be rounded to 2 decimal places. The records should be ordered in descending order of 'total' revenue.

This analysis aims to offer insights into customer-specific revenue generation, aiding in business decision-making and financial reporting.
