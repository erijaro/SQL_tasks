# Retailers and Licensed Products

This project focuses on managing and analyzing licensed products sold by three different retailers. The primary objective is to work with product lists and determine licensing status.

## Introduction

- There are three retailers selling licensed products.
- The "Master list" contains products that are licensed.
- All products with the brand "Jurassic World" are considered licensed.

## Tasks

### 1. Make a List of All Products

To begin, compile a comprehensive list of all products available across the three retailers. This list will serve as the foundation for further analysis.

### 2. Identify Overlapping Products

Identify products that appear in more than one list, based on their names. This information can help retailers streamline their inventory and avoid redundancy.

### 3. Determine Unlicensed Products

Based on product names, find and list products that are not considered licensed.
